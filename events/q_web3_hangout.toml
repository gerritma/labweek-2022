The Q team invites you to join them for breakfast, lunch, or aperitivo on November 3rd. A breath of fresh air, away from the Web Summit buzz and a chance to munch, network, and learn about Web3 governance that works for humans and societies.  

Discover why good governance is a game changer for blockchain projects and how DAOs, DeFi Projects, and the Metaverse benefit from governance that bridges “code is law” with humanity's most established and equitable legal systems, making it possible for automated efficiency and human complexity to co-exist online. 

To access the food and drinks, mint your NFT ticket for free. Minting will be enabled a few days before the event 

Seats are limited! 


About Q: 

Q is the decentralized governance system for the Web3. 

Its novel Layer-1 public blockchain offers a governance protocol meticulously designed for Web3 entities. Instead of building a governance system from scratch, any company, community, or DAO can integrate with Q. Its human-centred, ready-to-use, fully decentralised governance infrastructure makes it easy to launch bespoke, secure and fair processes for decision-making, enforcement and dispute resolution. Q’s modern governance approach bridges “code is law” with humanity's most established and equitable legal systems, making it possible for automated efficiency and human complexity to co-exist online. Q is an open-source project supported by the Q International Foundation.
